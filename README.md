This extension injects sctime in messages, it is designed for Kiwi IRC.

Please note that this extension currently uses ManifestV2 and not V3.

How to install:

Chrome:
To install, simply download the latest release, unzip the file and then in chrome://extensions enable programmer mode, click import uncompressed extension and then select the unzipped folder.

Firefox:
To install, simply download the latest release, unzip the file. Go to about:debugging in the address bar, then click on "this firefox". After that click on "load temporary extension" then choose any file inside the unzipped folder.

You can also install the extension with the .xpi file, though this may not work on regular firefox installations as it is not signed. It should however work on firefox developer edition.

If you want to try doing that, do this: go into about:addons in firefox, next click on the cogwheel and select install addon from file, then choose the .xpi file.

NOTE: If using firefox, the extension will disappear after restarting the browser using this method.
